# Using Agent Skills

## Overview

Agent Skills is a collection of engineering workflow skills organized by development phase. Each skill encodes a specific process that senior engineers follow. This meta-skill helps you discover and apply the right skill for your current task.

This meta-skill is auto-injected at session start via the `~/.config/agent-skills/hooks/session-start.sh` hook — no manual activation needed. The hook is configured in your harness settings.

## Skill Discovery

When a task arrives, identify the development phase and apply the corresponding skill:

```
Task arrives
    │
    ├── Don't know what you want yet? ──────→ interview-me
    ├── Have a rough concept, need variants? → idea-refine
    ├── New project/feature/change? ──→ spec-driven-development
    ├── Have a spec, need tasks? ──────→ planning-and-task-breakdown
    ├── Implementing code? ────────────→ incremental-implementation
    │   ├── UI work? ─────────────────→ frontend-ui-engineering
    │   ├── API work? ────────────────→ api-and-interface-design
    │   ├── Need better context? ─────→ context-engineering
    │   ├── Need doc-verified code? ───→ source-driven-development
    │   ├── Stakes high / unfamiliar code? ──→ doubt-driven-development
    │   └── Handling failures/resilience? ──→ error-handling-and-resilience
    ├── Writing/running tests? ────────→ test-driven-development
    │   └── Browser-based? ───────────→ browser-testing-with-devtools
    ├── Something broke? ──────────────→ debugging-and-error-recovery
    ├── Reviewing code? ───────────────→ code-review-and-quality
    │   ├── Security concerns? ───────→ security-and-hardening
    │   ├── Performance concerns? ────→ performance-optimization
    │   └── Code hard to read/maintain? → code-simplification
    ├── Committing/branching? ─────────→ git-workflow-and-versioning
    ├── CI/CD pipeline work? ──────────→ ci-cd-and-automation
    ├── Writing docs/ADRs? ───────────→ documentation-and-adrs
    ├── Deploying/launching? ─────────→ shipping-and-launch
    └── Removing or migrating old code? → deprecation-and-migration
```

## Skill Rules

1. **Check for an applicable skill before starting work.** Skills encode processes that prevent common mistakes.
2. **Multiple skills can apply in sequence.** A feature might involve `idea-refine` → `spec-driven-development` → `planning-and-task-breakdown` → `incremental-implementation` → `test-driven-development` → `code-review-and-quality` → `shipping-and-launch`.
3. **When in doubt, start with a spec.** If the task is non-trivial and there's no spec, begin with `spec-driven-development`.

## Lifecycle Sequence

For a complete feature, the typical skill sequence is:

```
1.  interview-me                → Extract what the user actually wants
2.  idea-refine                 → Refine vague ideas
3.  spec-driven-development     → Define what we're building
4.  planning-and-task-breakdown → Break into verifiable chunks
5.  context-engineering         → Load the right context
6.  source-driven-development   → Verify against official docs
7.  incremental-implementation  → Build slice by slice
8.  doubt-driven-development    → Cross-examine non-trivial decisions in-flight
9.  error-handling-and-resilience → Design resilience: retries, breakers, degradation
10. test-driven-development     → Prove each slice works
11. code-review-and-quality     → Review before merge
12. code-simplification         → Simplify for clarity (ongoing)
13. git-workflow-and-versioning → Clean commit history
14. documentation-and-adrs      → Document decisions
15. shipping-and-launch         → Deploy safely
16. deprecation-and-migration   → Sunset old APIs and migrate users
```

Not every task needs every skill. A bug fix might only need: `debugging-and-error-recovery` → `test-driven-development` → `code-review-and-quality`. Simplification and deprecation are ongoing maintenance activities applied as needed.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Skill | One-Line Summary |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Define | interview-me | Surface what the user actually wants before any plan, spec, or code exists |
| Define | idea-refine | Refine ideas through structured divergent and convergent thinking |
| Define | spec-driven-development | Requirements and acceptance criteria before code |
| Plan | planning-and-task-breakdown | Decompose into small, verifiable tasks |
| Build | incremental-implementation | Thin vertical slices, test each before expanding |
| Build | source-driven-development | Verify against official docs before implementing |
| Build | doubt-driven-development | Adversarial fresh-context review of every non-trivial decision |
| Build | error-handling-and-resilience | Retry, circuit breakers, graceful degradation, dead letter queues |
| Build | context-engineering | Right context at the right time |
| Build | frontend-ui-engineering | Production-quality UI with accessibility |
| Build | api-and-interface-design | Stable interfaces with clear contracts |
| Verify | test-driven-development | Failing test first, then make it pass |
| Verify | browser-testing-with-devtools | Chrome DevTools MCP for runtime verification |
| Verify | debugging-and-error-recovery | Reproduce → localize → fix → guard |
| Review | code-review-and-quality | Five-axis review with quality gates |
| Review | security-and-hardening | OWASP prevention, input validation, least privilege |
